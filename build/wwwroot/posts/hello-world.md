# Hello World
*Published 18/09/2025*

This is my first blog post using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). I've been meaning to start one for awhile to document my journey as a Software Developer and a lot has happened in my life since I became a Dev I honestly don't know where to start. 
Well, let's start from the beginning. 
My name is Samson, I come from an Accounting background and around 2020, at the age of 32, I made the tough decision to change careers, a complete 180 on everything I know and have learnt up until this point. The decision wasn't easy, and honestly quite scary, as is any major change in life. 
My motivation behind this change was done to a few things but ultimately I just wasn't enjoying the work I was doing as an Accounts Assistant, being under paid also didn't help either lol. 
So why Software Development, out of everything else I could've chosen...well it's simple. Myspace, for those fortunate enough to have been born pre 2000 (before 94/95 to be specific) we had something called Myspace, it was Facebook before Facebook and boy was it fun. But more important than that, it was coding, without knowing you was coding (well at least for me anyway). So when I was speaking to the few contacts I have about possible career changes, everyone was saying "Tech this", "Tech that!" So when I googled tech roles and saw a few I liked the look off, I came across Web Development and found an online introduction to html, wrote my first <H1>"Hello World!"</H1> and got hooked like a fish in water, and seeing this little piece of code appear on the screen felt like *TRIGGER WARNING*when an addict gets that first high and then keeps on taking, to continuously chase that high and that sent me into a deep rabbit hole of learning the basic front-end fundamentals (html, CSS & JavaScript)...So it was mid-late 2021, I'm working full-time as an Accounts Assistant, working part-time (evenings) at a local retailer, I have a kid on the way (our first) and I'm finding any spare time between all of that to study, practise & build projects. 
One thing I will say, those YouTube videos you see where people say, "How to become a Dev in 3 months" or "How I become a developer with no experience/CS degree within 1 month" are ALL LIARS! 
Becoming a developer isn't something you can learn in a month or three, there are senior developers with decades of experience, still learning, til this day. You could read a whole html, CSS & JavaScript text book in a few months, but that doesn't make you a developer, can you put what you've learnt into practise, can you think outside the box when your code won't run, do you like bug fixing (Tbh no one should love bug fixing 🙄), can you listen to constructive criticism, these things, to name but a few are what makes people really call themselves a developer. 
Anyway, I had my first child in 2021, I didn't build my first real world project (My first ever portfolio (I've changed this many times over since then)) until mid-late 2022 & didn't land my first junior developer role until 2023 at the age of 35.
